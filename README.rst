 Atlite
========

Atlite is the light-weight version of Aarhus RE Atlas for converting
weather data to power systems data.

Atlite is a `free software
<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html>`_ library to easily
generate renewable energy time-series from historical reanalysis
weather data like the cfsr rda ucar data set using python. 

As of 2016 REAtlite is under heavy development and therefore it is
recommended to use caution when using it in a production environment.

Atlite was initially developed by the `Renewable Energy Group
<https://fias.uni-frankfurt.de/physics/schramm/complex-renewable-energy-networks/>`_
at `FIAS <https://fias.uni-frankfurt.de/>`_ to carry out simulations
for the `CoNDyNet project <http://condynet.de/>`_, financed by the
`German Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF)
<https://www.bmbf.de/en/index.html>`_ as part of the `Stromnetze
Research Initiative
